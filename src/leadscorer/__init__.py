"""leadscorer: generic framework for cross-referencing commercial property
records against permit history to surface retrofit-lead candidates.

This is the free/course/public package. It knows nothing about any
specific client, scraping target, or hosting provider -- those belong in
a downstream deployment package (e.g. a paid "full" overlay) that depends
on this one. Same split as `bidscraper` (Tool 1) -- see that repo's
ARCHITECTURE.md for the pattern this follows.

import truststore

# See bidscraper's __init__.py for why: the OS-native trust store is a
# safe superset of certifi's bundled CA list and avoids TLS verification
# failures behind local HTTPS-inspecting security software.
